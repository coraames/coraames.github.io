										<p>I recorded from large populations of neurons in motor control areas of the brain,
										during one-handed and two handed movements. Even though each side of the brain sends commands
										to one side of the body, both sides of the brain contained detailed signals related to both arms.
										This might at first seem to pose a problem: how can the brain send commands to only one arm if signals for
										both arms are all mixed up? I found that signals for each arm occupied different "neural dimensions":
										they were structured in a way that ensured that they could be read out separately.

											<h3 class="major">Motor cortex signals for each arm are mixed across hemispheres and neurons yet partitioned within the population response</h3>
											<p>Motor cortex (M1) has lateralized outputs, yet M1 neurons can be active during movements of either arm. What is the nature and role of activity in the two hemispheres? We recorded muscles and neurons bilaterally while monkeys cycled with each arm. Neurons were active when either arm moved but with arm-dependent responses, raising two possibilities. First, population-level signals may differ depending on the arm being used. Second, the same population-level signals may be present, but be distributed differently across neurons. The data supported this second hypothesis. Both hemispheres’ neural activity accurately predicted muscle activity, and we failed to find signals unique to the hemisphere contralateral to the moving arm. Yet if the same signals are shared across hemispheres, how do they avoid impacting the wrong arm? Each arm’s neural activity occupied a distinct subspace, enabling linear decodes of muscle activity to naturally ignore signals related to the other arm. </p>

											<h3 class="major">Neural Dynamics of Reaching following Incorrect or Absent Motor Preparation</h3>
											<p>Moving is thought to take separate preparation and execution steps. During preparation, neural activity in primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices achieves a state specific to an upcoming action but movements are not performed until the execution phase. We investigated whether this preparatory state (more precisely, prepare-and-hold state) is required for movement execution using two complementary experiments. We compared monkeys’ neural activity during delayed and nondelayed reaches and in a delayed reaching task in which the target switched locations on a small percentage of trials. Neural population activity bypassed the prepare-and-hold state both in the absence of a delay and if the wrong reach was prepared. However, the initial neural response to the target was similar across behavioral conditions. This suggests that the prepare-and-hold state can be bypassed if needed, but there is a short-latency preparatory step that is performed prior to movement even without a delay.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Latent Factors and Dynamics in Motor Cortex and Their Application to Brain–Machine Interfaces</h3>
											<p>In the 1960s, Evarts first recorded the activity of single neurons in motor cortex of behaving monkeys (Evarts, 1968). In the 50 years since, great effort has been devoted to understanding how single neuron activity relates to movement. Yet these single neurons exist within a vast network, the nature of which has been largely inaccessible. With advances in recording technologies, algorithms, and computational power, the ability to study these networks is increasing exponentially. Recent experimental results suggest that the dynamical properties of these networks are critical to movement planning and execution. Here we discuss this dynamical systems perspective and how it is reshaping our understanding of the motor cortices. Following an overview of key studies in motor cortex, we discuss techniques to uncover the “latent factors” underlying observed neural population activity. Finally, we discuss efforts to use these factors to improve the performance of brain–machine interfaces, promising to make these findings broadly relevant to neuroengineering as well as systems neuroscience.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Accurate estimation of neural population dynamics without spike sorting</h3>
											<p>A central goal of systems neuroscience is to relate an organism's neural activity to behavior. Neural population analysis often begins by reducing the dimensionality of the data to focus on the patterns most relevant to a given task. A major practical hurdle to data analysis is spike sorting, and this problem is growing rapidly as the number of neurons measured increases. Here, we investigate whether spike sorting is necessary to estimate neural dynamics. The theory of random projections suggests that we can accurately estimate the geometry of low-dimensional manifolds from a small number of linear projections of the data. We re-analyzed data from three previous studies and found that neural dynamics and scientific conclusions are quite similar using multi-unit threshold crossings in place of sorted neurons. This finding unlocks existing data for new analyses and informs the design and use of new electrode arrays for laboratory and clinical use.</p>
